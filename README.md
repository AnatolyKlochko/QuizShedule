# QuizShedule
**Raw version** of QuizShedule module on Moodle 3.6, that implements business logic which allows to control timely passing of exams by company employees.

The module is fully worked. Although in some places it has no optimizations or sequrity protection.

This version of the module was designed and implemented by me myself.

According to the latest information, this version of the module ( with very small additions ) is currently used by JSC "POLTAVAOBLENERGO".

# Story
The module **was ordered by** JSC "POLTAVAOBLENERGO" at april 2019, namely by the Director of the HR Department **Alexander Kirichenko** and, according to his words, to have the ability to collect statistics about the most problem quizzes and subsequently more effectively direct the resources of the Education Center of the JSC "POLTAVAOBLENERGO" to overcome those problems.

At the beginning of 2020, from my side, works on the module development, factually, were stopped, due to **inadequate salary level** for this type of work, which at that time was only 9 000 UAH (about 350 USD ) per month, while the salary level for this type of work should start from 4 000 USD per month at least.

The requests to set the appropriate salary level to the JSC "POLTAVAOBLENERGO" (namely to the Director of the HR Department Alexander Kirichenko and the Director of IT Department **Vladislav Chaika**), factually, were rejected.

Taking into account the facts, set out in this section, I strongly recommend, along business relationships with such companies, rely only on the very clear duties of the customer and the executor within the signed contract, and not just on the promises of very **cunning persons**.
